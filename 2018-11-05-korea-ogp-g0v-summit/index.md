## Ideas behind g0v

I'm here to talk about g0v, but no to represent g0v, because:

* nobody represents g0v
* ask not why nobody is doing something, because you are that nobody
* everyone can represent her own view of g0v

1. We run by >= 100 volunteers each time.
2. We have more and more people each time.
3. We have Korean speakers each time!

---

Personal view: We have shifted our focus from

* ..."how to get started / what have we achived" in 2014
* ...to "how do we work with other domains" in 2016
* ... to "why didn't it work / what are the lessons learned" in 2018

## What we tried to do this year

As part of the programming committee in 2018 and programming task force in 2016, I think we have (aside from actually have a summit) been trying to focus on: 

* honesty
* not only "good news"
* self-criticism: work condition, actual impact, political reality, etc.
* community-centered

I would not say that we are "inclusive".  We do value inclusiveness, but we trying to be as inclusive as we could within our limits.

These are tho joint work of all [our staffs](https://summit.g0v.tw/2018/staff)

## how did we organize g0v summit

---

Roughly speaking:

1. Someone started by "digging a hole".  She or he usually become the director/chair of the summit.
2. Leaders of various "task forces", head of programming committee were inquired/picked by the director. 
3. Each of the task force leaders would then find their own staff.  [This year's staff](https://summit.g0v.tw/2018/staff).

---

The preparation started one year ago at November 2017.

---

Each of the task forces would usually choose their own governance model.  Some could be more centralised, or some staff would have complete control over a subject.

We try to allow spaces for different governance model. 多種組織方式能夠各自生長的地方.
