I like to present the definitions first.  Please bare with me, and it will be relevant soon in 5 minutes.  You will need to know the concept of continuous maps, product space, and groups.

So time for some examples.  Obviously we should start with Mobius strips.  But let us begin with something almost trivial.  Here is a tube brush.

Here is a bagel cut into Mobius strip.  So the group I was talking about in the definition.  It's here.  It's $\mathbb{Z}/2$ in this case.  You see, now you cannot spread jam on one side of it and butter on the other, because there is only one side.

And then it's Klein bottle.

The last case I will talk about is vector bundle.  Why is this relevant?  There is a sf novel *Diaspora* where people turned themselves into the entities in the fibre space, thereby escaped a catastrophe in the universe.  This is just one example of the aftermath of turning human into posthuman.  Personally I think the genre works have only stratched the surface of this issue, so I'd like to show you a more far-reaching thought experiments.  I think the book *How We Became Posthuman?* is a good reference in this respect if you are really interested.

Here are some references:

* Norman Steenrod, *The Topology of Fibre Bundles*.
* Greg Egan, *Diaspora*.
